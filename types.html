    <h1>🌬️TYPES OF WIND TURBINES</h1>

    <p>
      A wind turbine is a device that converts the kinetic energy of wind into electrical energy. It has large blades that catch the wind and rotate, turning a shaft connected to a generator. The generator then produces electricity through electromagnetic induction, a principle discovered by Michael Faraday. Wind turbines are mounted on tall towers to capture stronger winds and are controlled automatically to operate efficiently. There are two main types: horizontal-axis wind turbines, which look like large fans, and vertical-axis wind turbines, which can capture wind from any direction. They are widely used in wind farms, remote areas, and offshore locations to provide clean and renewable energy

    <p>Most common type

Looks like a fan

Used in large wind farms

B) Vertical Axis Wind Turbine (VAWT)

1.Blades rotate vertically

2.Works even if wind direction changes

-Companies like:

1.Vestas

2.Siemens Gamesa

Manufacture large wind turbines.</p>
