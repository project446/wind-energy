    <h1>👤Their Uses</h1>

    <p>Wind turbines are used in different ways depending on location and need. In wind farms, many turbines are installed together on land to produce large amounts of electricity that can be fed into the national grid for cities and industries. In villages and remote areas, smaller turbines provide local electricity, often powering homes, schools, or water pumps where grid connection is difficult. Offshore wind turbines are placed in the sea, where wind speeds are stronger and more consistent, allowing them to generate large amounts of clean electricity for nearby coastal areas or the main grid.</p>
