    <h1>👤 How it works</h1>

    <p> When the wind blows, it turns the large blades of the windmill.These rotating blades spin a shaft connected to a generator, which produces electricity.Modern windmills, also called wind turbines, are an important source of renewable energy because they do not cause air pollution and do not use fuel. They are often built in open areas such as hills, coastal regions, and large fields where wind is strong and steady. Windmills help reduce the use of fossil fuels and support a cleaner and more sustainable environment.</p>
