        <h1>Wind Energy & Turbines</h1>
        
        <p>Wind energy is a form of solar energy. It is created by the uneven heating of the Earth’s atmosphere by the sun, the irregularities of the Earth's surface, and the rotation of the planet. As the sun heats different areas of land and water at different rates, air begins to move from high-pressure areas to low-pressure areas, creating what we feel as wind. Because the sun will always shine and the air will always move, wind is considered a renewable and inexhaustible resource—it will never run out.</p>

        <h3>How do Windmills work?</h3>
        <p>A modern wind turbine works on a very simple principle: rather than using electricity to make wind—like a desk fan—it uses wind to make electricity. The process follows these steps:

Capturing the Wind: When the wind blows, it flows over the aerodynamically shaped blades of the turbine. This creates a pocket of low-pressure air on one side of the blade, which creates "lift" (the same force that allows airplanes to fly).

Rotation: This lift causes the rotor (the blades and the center hub) to spin.

Generation: The spinning rotor is connected to a main shaft, which enters a housing called a nacelle. Inside the nacelle, the shaft spins a generator.

Electricity: Using large magnets and copper wire coils, the generator converts that mechanical spinning motion into electrical energy.</p>
<h4>Why Use Wind Power?</h4>
       <p>Wind energy is one of the cleanest ways to produce power. Unlike coal or gas power plants, wind turbines do not skip any chemicals or "greenhouse gases" into the air, and they do not require water for cooling. While they are very tall, the actual footprint on the ground is small, allowing farmers to continue growing crops or grazing cattle right underneath the turbines. As technology improves, wind energy is becoming one of the cheapest ways to provide electricity to cities all over the world.</p>
