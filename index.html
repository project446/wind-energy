            <h3>100% Clean</h3>
            <p>A windmill is a machine that uses the energy of the wind to do work by converting wind energy into mechanical energy. When the wind blows, it turns the large blades of the windmill, which rotate a shaft inside the structure. This rotation is then used to perform tasks such as grinding grain into flour, pumping water from wells, or cutting wood. Windmills have been used for hundreds of years, especially in countries like the Netherlands, and they were very important before modern electricity was developed. Today, traditional windmills have inspired modern wind turbines, which generate electrical energy in an environmentally friendly way.</p>

            <h3>High Efficiency</h3>
            <p>Modern turbines convert up to 50% of wind energy into electricity.</p>
