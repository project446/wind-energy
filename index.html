        <h1>Wind Energy & Turbines</h1>
        
        <p>Wind energy is a form of solar energy. It is created by the uneven heating of the Earth’s atmosphere by the sun, the irregularities of the Earth's surface, and the rotation of the planet. As the sun heats different areas of land and water at different rates, air begins to move from high-pressure areas to low-pressure areas, creating what we feel as wind. Because the sun will always shine and the air will always move, wind is considered a renewable and inexhaustible resource—it will never run out.</p>

        <h3>How do Windmills work?</h3>
        <p>When wind blows past the blades, it creates a force called <em>lift</em>. This turns the rotor, which is connected to a generator. Inside the generator, magnets spin to create the electricity that powers our homes.</p>
