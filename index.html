            <h2>The Legacy of the <span>Wind Wheel</span></h2>
            <p>
                Before the modern turbine, there was the <strong>Wind Wheel</strong>. Originating over 1,000 years ago, 
                early wind wheels were vertical-axis machines used in Persia to grind grain and pump water. 
                By the 12th century, the iconic horizontal-axis "Dutch Windmill" appeared in Europe, 
                using massive canvas sails to harness the breeze.

                Today, the "wheel" has evolved. While ancient windmills relied on <em>drag</em> (the wind pushing 
                the blade), modern turbines use <strong>aerodynamic lift</strong>, allowing the blades to 
                spin much faster than the wind itself, generating significantly more power.

            <h2>Harnessing <span>Kinetic Energy</span></h2>
            <p>
                Wind energy is a form of solar energy. The sun unevenly heats the atmosphere, creating 
                pressure differences that result in wind. When this wind hits a turbine's blades, 
                it converts <strong>kinetic energy</strong> into mechanical energy.

                <li><strong>The Rotor:</strong> Captures the wind and begins the rotation.</li>
                <li><strong>The Gearbox:</strong> Speeds up the slow rotation of the blades to over 1,500 RPM.</li>
                <li><strong>The Generator:</strong> Uses magnetic fields to turn that rotation into electricity.</li>
